Greedy Service,order-service,"services/order/src/main/java/com/elsebaey/ecommerce/order/OrderService.java","L32-L69","OrderService.createOrder orchestrates customer lookup, product reservation, order persistence, order-line creation, payment initiation, and confirmation publishing in one transaction script instead of delegating those concerns to specialized modules."
Unstable Dependency,order-service,"services/order/src/main/java/com/elsebaey/ecommerce/order/OrderService.java; services/order/src/main/java/com/elsebaey/ecommerce/customer/CustomerClient.java; services/order/src/main/java/com/elsebaey/ecommerce/product/ProductClient.java; services/order/src/main/java/com/elsebaey/ecommerce/payment/PaymentClient.java","OrderService:L23-L58; CustomerClient:L9-L16; ProductClient:L19-L45; PaymentClient:L7-L14","Order service depends on live customer, product, and payment APIs through synchronous Feign and RestTemplate calls without any circuit breaker or fallback, so latency or instability in those downstream services immediately break order creation."
Hub-like Services,order-service,"services/order/src/main/java/com/elsebaey/ecommerce/order/OrderService.java; services/order/src/main/java/com/elsebaey/ecommerce/kafka/OrderProducer.java; services/order/src/main/java/com/elsebaey/ecommerce/product/ProductClient.java; services/order/src/main/java/com/elsebaey/ecommerce/payment/PaymentClient.java; services/order/src/main/java/com/elsebaey/ecommerce/customer/CustomerClient.java","OrderService:L23-L68; OrderProducer:L11-L25; ProductClient:L19-L45; PaymentClient:L7-L14; CustomerClient:L9-L16","Order service acts as a central hub that coordinates customer validation, product purchasing, payment requests, and Kafka notifications, creating high coupling between multiple bounded contexts through one orchestrator."
Broken Modularization,payment-service,"services/payment/src/main/java/com/elsebaey/ecommerce/payment/PaymentService.java; services/payment/src/main/java/com/elsebaey/ecommerce/notification/NotificationProducer.java; services/payment/src/main/java/com/elsebaey/ecommerce/notification/PaymentNotificationRequest.java; services/notification/src/main/java/com/elsebaey/ecommerce/kafka/NotificationConsumer.java","PaymentService:L3-L27; NotificationProducer:L1-L26; PaymentNotificationRequest:L1-L14; NotificationConsumer:L1-L64","Payment service embeds notification-domain classes and Kafka publisher logic under the com.elsebaey.ecommerce.notification package, duplicating notification concerns that already belong to the dedicated notification service and blurring module boundaries."
